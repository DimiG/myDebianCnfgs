=============
The repository contains the configuration files necessary to configure the [Debian][debian] [distribution][distro] for my tasks.

Project description
-------------------

`All`: **NOTE**
* Download the newly installed [Debian][debian] distribution and use these files instead of the installed ones.
I will try to automate this task a bit in the future.

***Requires :*** Fresh installed [Debian][debian] **Linux** [distro][distro].

`To be continued...`
