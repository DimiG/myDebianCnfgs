myDebianCnfgs
=============
The repository contains the configuration files necessary to configure the [Debian][debian] [distribution][distro] for my tasks.

Project description
-------------------

### myDebianCnfgs folders

* `root`: This folder is intended for the [BASH][bash] shell configuration files of the Linux [Debian][debian] `root` user.  

* `sys_cnfgs`: This folder contains the Linux [Debian][debian] system configuration files, as well as user configuration files located in the `/etc` folder.  

* `.vim`: This folder contains a simplified configuration of the [Vim][vim] editor.  

`All`: **NOTE**
* Download the newly installed [Debian][debian] distribution and use these files instead of the installed ones.
I will try to automate this task a bit in the future.

***Requires :*** Fresh installed [Debian][debian] **Linux** [distro][distro].
